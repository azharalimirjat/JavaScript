/*
Task 1: Using the logical && operator
You are coding an RPG game, where each character has certain skill levels based on the value saved in their score.

1. Create a variable named  score and set it to  8

2 Use console.log() that includes the string "Mid-level skills:" and 
  compares the score variable to above 0 and below 10 using the && operator

=> The expected output in the console should be: "Mid-level skills: true".
*/
var score = 8;
console.log("Mid-level skills:", score>0 && score<10)
